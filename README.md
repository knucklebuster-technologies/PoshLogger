<center>><h2>PoshLogger - A Good Logger for PowerShell</h2></center>

<p>DESCRIPTION:<br>
A Logging System for PowerShell that allows for multiple Loggers and Configurable Targets. PoshLogger looks not to replace the built in Cmdlets for Writing Information but to provide a flexible tool that can go from writing to the console to writing to a database with one line of powershell.
